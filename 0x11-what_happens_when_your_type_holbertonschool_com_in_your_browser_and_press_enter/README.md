 <h2>Background Context</h2>

<p>Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you&rsquo;re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.</p>

<p>A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security&hellip;) of the question.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can post your blog post on the platform of your choice, LinkedIn or Medium are good ones</li>
<li>A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>

 <p>This question is a classic and still widely used interview question for many types of software engineering position. It is used to assess a candidates general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that you should ask your interviewer whether they would like you to focus in on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position they may want you to talk at length about how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position they may want you to go into the load balancing mechanism.</p>

<p>This question is a good test of whether you understand DNS. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, so if you do well on this question, you are already way ahead of the curve. If you take this project seriously and write an excellent article, it may be something that will grab the attention of future employers.</p>
